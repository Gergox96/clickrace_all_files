        <h3>Prototype
        </h3>
        <p>The Click Race prototype has taken some directional shifts since the ideation phase of the project. Initially, 4 users were supposed to connect to the web page and select a colour. <br>The user would then become locked in and ONLY have access to clicking on their colour of choice. All 4 users would then click as fast as they can to race against the other opponents.</p>

            <p>Here are two screenshots from the prototype building process. The second screenshot is closer to the final version, but I wanted to run you through my thought process with this one. <br><br> Click Race was intended to be like the internet version of Hungry Hungry Hippos, all 4 users would be clicking like crazy until somebody wins, however, that idea changed through the process.<br><br>Here you can clearly see 4 buttons with no other options. Simply just click away at your colour and the code takes care of the rest.

            <p>In this version however, you'll quickly note that there is a new button labelled, "Erase Bet". I realised that there would most likely be complications and latency issues with 4 different users constantly clicking on buttons. So to solve this issue, I reshaped the idea of Click Race around race betting.<br><br>
            With the addition of bet placing, there is now an obvious, "Start" and "Stop" buttons. This simplifies the code to a boolean level where the circuit only has to thing, <br><br>"Okay, is the data a 1 or a 0? 1=start, 0=stop."

        <h3>The Building Phase
        </h3>
        <p>Here is a brief look at the building process behind Click Race! After ordering 4 Continous Servo Motors with Wheels from Amazon and a 1000mAh 3.7v battery from Canada Robotix, it was just a waiting game for the parts. <br>After they had finally arrived, I quickly got to work on the circuit. Here it is...</p>

            <p>In this video, I am just simply checking if all of my Servo Motors are working as intended. I was testing out a piece of code that would tell the Motors to rotate 180 degrees clock-wise and then counter clock-wise.</p>

            <p>In this video, I changed the code to work with my P5.js web page. I wanted to keep all the variables and connections in the code from the guide togther, so I only implemented small parts of my own code over the guide's code. Therefore, I was only able to get one Servo Motor working for now, however, the Motor continously spins with a delay between rotations. I am assuming the Arduino code is holding the data value as "1". My next challenge is to get the P5.js sketch to change that data value to a "0".</p>

        <h3>The Code
        </h3>
        <p>Seemed easy enough to follow with YouTube guides and official guides from class. It was all going so well until I could not get my P5.js web sketch to communicate with my Arduino sketch. I found immediate success with getting the Feather Huzzah to communicate with a P5.js sketch, but not the other way around. I will be attempting to connect with MQTT rather than an API next time. To my knowledge there are no errors in the code, I have tried what I can but to no avail I cannot get the code to work as intended.</p>

In this screenshot you can see I have commented out my previous code that I wanted to work for Click Race! and was last attempting to get Guide 3 from class to work oncemore. <br><br>I have regenerated API keys, I have started new feeds, I have started new files, I am not sure what my issue is here but I very much look forward to solving it so I can move forward.
